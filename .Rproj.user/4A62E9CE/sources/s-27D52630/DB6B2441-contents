Let's go through how to make a basic presentation using `rpptx`!

`rpptx` leverages the power of the `officer` package and the ease of use of powerpoint
templates to create a simple and easy to use API to create powerpoint slide decks
straight from R. Therefore, the first thing we need to do is to choose a powerpoint
template. This is a normal `.pptx` file that has the template we want in `Slide Master`. By default, `rpptx` uses the default template in `officer`, which seems 
like a slight variation on the default Microsoft powerpoint template.

Let's start by creating a `presentation`.

```{r}
presentation <- new_presentation()
print(presentation)
print(template_path(presentation))
```

We can see this is an empty presentation with the template path set to the default
`officer` template. What's in this template? We can check easily using some utility functions.

```{r}
get_layouts(presentation)
```

This template has seven different layouts. That's good to know, but it doesn't help us
entirely figure out which layout to use for which purpose. Let's keep going!

```{r}
layouts <- get_layouts(presentation)$layout
for (layout in layouts) {
  plot_layout(presentation, layout)
  title(main = layout)
}
```

Now we can see for each slide layout what options we have to use as placeholders! Knowing this, we can move forward and start constructing our presentation!

In `r2pptx` syntax, `presentations` are made up of `slides` which are made up of `elements`. `elements` represent anything we want to add to the deck -- text, plots, images, tables, etc. Anything compatible with the `officer` package works here!

We start out making a title slide with a title and subtitle. We give `elements` for
the title and subtitle as arguments to the `new_slide()` function. And we give "Title Slide" 
as the layout name, per the information from above.

```{r}
title_slide <- new_slide(
  new_element(key = "Title 1", value = "The title"),
  new_element(key = "Subtitle 2", value = "The subtitle"),
  layout = "Title Slide"
)
```

Now we add the title slide to our presentation.

```{r}
presentation <- presentation + title_slide
```

Easy!

Let's add another slide with a ggplot. This time, we'll add the `elements` to the `slide`
rather than initializing the `slide` with `elements`.

```{r}
plot_slide <- new_slide(layout = "Title and Content")
title_element <- new_element(key = "Title 1", value = "A plot")
cars_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) + 
  geom_point()
plot_element <- new_element(key = "Content Placeholder 2", value = cars_plot)

plot_slide <- plot_slide +
  title_element +
  plot_element

presentation <- presentation +
  plot_slide
```

And then we can write the `presentation` to powerpoint.

```{r}
ppt_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".pptx")
write_pptx(presentation, ppt_path)
if (interactive()) system(paste("open", ppt_path))
```

And you have a slide deck! Congrats!
