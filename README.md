`r2pptx` leverages the power of the `officer` package and the ease of
use of powerpoint templates to form a simple and easy to use API to
create powerpoint slide decks straight from R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of r2pptx from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mattle24/r2pptx")
```

[Documentation is available online](https://mattle24.github.io/r2pptx/)
or through the vignettes.
